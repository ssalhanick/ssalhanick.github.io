					<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Tenetur animi tempore veritatis rerum. Nesciunt nostrum, natus, fugit libero quod cum eligendi magnam mollitia voluptas harum quidem. Unde voluptatibus, cupiditate rerum.</p>
					<!-- <p>Our paths should have crossed many times before we met. Like 2 stars orbiting around each other, silent near misses without even realizing. Until one day, the stars collide and something beautiful is made. Though even with stars, it takes a little while for the beauty to be fully imagined.</p>
					<p>Quinn and Scott met on the roof of a bar next to an old hospital in 2012. We should have met while in college as we both attended Loyola University Chicago. We had mutual friends and ate at the same dining hall. Maybe if Scott was a better student, he would have run into Quinn in the quiet areas of the library. Maybe if Quinn took a break from studying, she would have seen Scott at a pep rally or [sock hop].</p>
					<p>They first shared a meal at Terilli's because Scott's boss said it was romantic. What Scott didn't realize was that that actually meant 'expensive'. Since then, Quinn and Scott have shared many meals better than that one. They have made a home and life together with their cat, Aristolia.</p> -->
